            </h2>
            <p class="lead">As an information professional my work revolves around creating, processing and updating data. Various files might go through two hundred revisions before they are finally complete. Each of these revisions takes up space and may lead to numerous problems or bugs. There is also the problem of two authors overriding each others work on accident. These generally are not huge issues when working on singular files but can lead to huge issues when you have hundreds or thousands of files. Version control systems looks to solve this problem. They allow multiple users control over past and present versions of a file. The premise is that files are kept on a cloud repository. Users are then able to check the file out to their own local repository and make changes to the file without changing the main file. They can then commit these changes to the cloud and change the file. The VCS then tracks who commited the file and keeps the old version available. It also allows the merging of different file versions. This means that the changes commited by multiple users can be merged to get the final version with changes from both.  </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Github</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Github is a popular VCS used by many large companies. It is fast and modern and a leader in VCS. Github provides several advantages. It provides change logs for all types of data such a html files, images, javascript, etc. It allows files to br brought together under collaborative effort. Files can be changed and merged together allowing a final version to be created from the work of multiple authors. It also provides a simple user interface so a person doesn't have to be a cumputer science major to use it. Simple additions such as being able to click though menus and the addition of pastable command prompts allow all users to get the most out of the system. Git is locally enabled. This means that there is no setting up of infrastructure and  managing of servers. Git can be managed straight from any desktop. Git is also built from the ground up for team collaboration. In a modern information workforce, the work done on a single files by mutliple people doesnt happen in succession. Overlaps and breaks are common in peoples work time and git adjusts for this.</p>

        <!-- Third Featurette -->
        <div class="featurette" id="topic3">

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Highlight #3
                <span class="text-muted">Master file, push, pull, and merge</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git works under the premise of a master file. This is the current main file commited to git. For someone to work on this file they check it out from the main repository. This does not change the file but allows them to work on specific features of the file. once they have finished their enhancements, they can then push the file back to the main repository. These changes can be commited or left for later for further enhancements by any user. Git simplifies these by command prompts. files can also be simply merged. Say you have two programmers working on different but related files. Once these files are pushed to git they can be merged from the command line. For example, if john is working on a new logo for a page and jim is working on the page itsself, once john uploads the logo, jim can pull it merge it with his copy of the master and then push that to the main server and commit it. Thus, both john and jims work is commited even if they were working and the same time. Git even accounts for discrepcies in this by checking the files to see if they cause problems. If so git provides solutions to this through options on how to relate or replace the content of the files. It then allows rollback of these changes to previous versions.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git commands.</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">git is operated by command line prompts to execute operations. git commit allows you to commit your changes to the file. You use this to save the changes you have made to a file on your local repository. git checkout lets your checkout a file. You use this to view different branches of the repository. Git init intializes a repository. This means that you initialize a local repository for enhancement of files. get add. adds all files to the staging area where you can then commit them. this is used before you commit files as you may want to ignore some files. Git push allows you to push the files to the main repository. Thus your files are available through github. Git pull allows you to pull the files from a main repository. This allows you to pull files to merge.git clone allows you to clone a remote repository. This allows you to bring the current head files from the remote repository.</p>

        <!-- Fifth Featurette -->

                <span class="text-muted">Other git features.</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git allows you to create branches off of the main file. This can be used for developing side projects or two different options for a main project. It then allows you to bring these branches back into the main branch and add or delete these branches at will. You can even pull updates from the main branch into the side branch if the main branch is updated while you are working. These branches accomplish the same thing as having multiple edits of the same file. For instance one edit of a HTML file might have a background color set as black while another has it set as red and the main branch has no background color at all. If the number of sections in this page was changed while you were working you could then pull those changes and still have your background color. Each individual line of code is also attributed to its author in git allowing you to see who developed a specific part of a file (or who is to blame for a bug). It allows you to see the changes between your current workspace and the files in the repository. It also allows you to easily connect with development services like Cloud 9 and directly control your repository from their command prompts. It also allows you to add notes to commits and other areas for attribution and detail about the changes.</p>
